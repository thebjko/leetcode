# [1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-17)

Given a binary tree `root` and an integer `target`, delete all the leaf nodes with value `target`.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value `target`, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target,` `it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def removeLeafNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root is None:
            return

        root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)
        root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)

        if root.left is None and root.right is None and root.val == target:
            return

        return root
```

Post order traversal with recursion.

### Approach 2: Iteration

```python
class Solution:
    def removeLeafNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        stack = []
        current_node = root
        last_right_node = None

        while stack or current_node:
            # Push left nodes to the stack until reaching the leftmost node.
            while current_node:
                stack.append(current_node)
                current_node = current_node.left

            # Access the top node on the stack without removing it.
            # This node is the current candidate for processing.
            current_node = stack[-1]

            # Check if the current node has an unexplored right subtree.
            # If so, shift to the right subtree unless it's the subtree we just visited.
            if current_node.right and current_node.right is not last_right_node:
                current_node = current_node.right
                continue  # Continue in the while loop to push this new subtree's leftmost nodes.

            # Remove the node from the stack, since we're about to process it.
            stack.pop()

            # If the node has no right subtree or the right subtree has already been visited,
            # then check if it is a leaf node with the target value.
            if not current_node.right and not current_node.left and current_node.val == target:
                # If the stack is empty after popping, it means the root was a target leaf node.
                if not stack:
                    return None  # The tree becomes empty as the root itself is removed.

                # Identify the parent of the current node.
                parent = stack[-1] if stack else None

                # Disconnect the current node from its parent.
                if parent and parent.left is current_node:
                    parent.left = None  # If current is a left child, set the left pointer to null.
                elif parent and parent.right is current_node:
                    parent.right = None  # If current is a right child, set the right pointer to null.

            # Mark this node as visited by setting 'last_right_node' to 'current_node' before moving to the next iteration.
            last_right_node = current_node
            # Reset 'current_node' to None to ensure the next node from the stack is processed.
            current_node = None

        return root  # Return the modified tree
