# [506. Relative Ranks](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-08)

You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be **unique**.

The athletes are **placed** based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

- The 1st place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
- The 2nd place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
- The 3rd place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
- For the 4th place to the <code>n<sup>th</sup></code> place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the <code>x<sup>th</sup></code> place athlete's rank is `"x"`).

Return an array answer of size n where `answer[i]` is the rank of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> athlete.

## My Solution: Priority Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, score: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        hq = []
        for i, s in enumerate(score):
            heappush(hq, (-int(s), i))
        
        ans = [''] * len(score)
        for i in range(len(score)):
            _, idx = heappop(hq)
            match i:
                case 0:
                    ans[idx] = 'Gold Medal'
                case 1:
                    ans[idx] = 'Silver Medal'
                case 2:
                    ans[idx] = 'Bronze Medal'
                case _:
                    ans[idx] = str(i+1)
        return ans
```

### Approach 1: Sort & Reverse

```python
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, score: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        N = len(score)
       
        # Save the index of each athelete
        score_to_index = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            score_to_index[score[i]] = i

        # Sort score in descending order
        score.sort(reverse = True)

        # Assign ranks to athletes
        rank = [" "] * N
        for i in range(N):
            if i == 0:
                rank[score_to_index[score[i]]] = "Gold Medal"
            elif i == 1:
                rank[score_to_index[score[i]]] = "Silver Medal"
            elif i == 2:
                rank[score_to_index[score[i]]] = "Bronze Medal"
            else:
                rank[score_to_index[score[i]]] = str(i + 1)

        return rank
```

### Approach 3: Array as Map

```python
class Solution:
    def find_max(self, score):
        max_score = 0
        for s in score:
            if s > max_score :
                max_score = s
        return max_score

    def findRelativeRanks(self, score):
        N = len(score)

        # Add the original index of each score to the array
        # Where the score is the key
        M = self.find_max(score)
        score_to_index = [0] * (M + 1)
        for i in range(N):
            score_to_index[score[i]] = i + 1

        MEDALS = ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal"]

        # Assign ranks to athletes
        rank = [None] * N
        place = 1
        for i in range(M, -1, -1):
            if score_to_index[i] != 0:
                original_index = score_to_index[i] - 1
                if place < 4:
                    rank[original_index] = MEDALS[place - 1]
                else:
                    rank[original_index] = str(place)
                place += 1
        return rank
```
