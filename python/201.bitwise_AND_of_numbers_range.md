# [201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-21)

Two numbers are given. These numbers indicates a range of integers inclusive. You are asked to get the result of bitwise AND operation of all numbers.

# Solution

Iteration will exceed the time limit. Find the **common prefix**.

## Approach 1: Bit Shift

1. Reduce both numbers into their common prefix, by doing the right shift iteratively. Keep the count of the operation.
2. Restore the common prefix to its original position. 

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        shift = 0   
        # find the common 1-bits
        while m < n:
            m = m >> 1
            n = n >> 1
            shift += 1
        return m << shift

```

## Approach 2: Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

Do bitwise AND on `n` and `n-1`. This will "turn off" the rightmost bit of one in the original number. For example `0b1100` and `0b1011` will turn into `0b1000`. If `n` is power of two, the result will be 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        while m < n:
            # turn off rightmost 1-bit
            n = n & (n - 1)
        return m & n

```
