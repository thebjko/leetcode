# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows of Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-18)

A list of balloons' x-axis locations is given. Arrow is shoot directly vertically. Return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key=itemgetter(1))

        cnt = 0
        prev = -float('inf')
        for x, y in points:
            if x > prev:
                cnt += 1
                prev = y

        return cnt
```

Sort by end coordinate. Then all balloons that starts before one end can be shot by one arrow. If a balloon starts after the previous end, another arrow is needed.
