# 861. Score After Flipping Matrix

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

A **move** consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all `0`'s to `1`'s, and all `1`'s to `0`'s).

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the **score** of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return *the highest possible **score** after making any number of moves **(**including zero moves).*

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def matrixScore(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        m = len(grid[0])
        for row in grid:
            if row[0] == 0:
                for idx, val in enumerate(row):
                    row[idx] = val^1

        res = 0
        for i, row in enumerate(zip(*grid)):
            s = sum(row)
            res += (1 << (m-1-i)) * max(s, n-s)

        return res
```

Since the left-most numbers have the most weight, we convert them to `1`'s. Then for each column, we count which of `1` and `0` are more. If there are more `1`'s than `0`'s, we add to `res` accordingly. If there are more `0`'s, we convert them to `1` and increment `res` accordingly(here, however, does not perform the conversion but count the number of `0`'s to increment `res`).
