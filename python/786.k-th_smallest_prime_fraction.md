# [786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-10)

You are given a sorted integer array `arr` containing `1` and prime numbers, where all the integers of `arr` are unique. You are also given an integer `k`.

For every `i` and `j` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`, we consider the fraction `arr[i] / arr[j]`.

Return the <code>k<sup>th</sup></code> smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size `2`, where `answer[0] == arr[i]` and `answer[1] == arr[j]`.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        return list(
	        sorted(product(arr, repeat=2), key=lambda x: x[0] / x[1])[k-1]
		)
```

Brute force is an easy approach to this problem. This approach, however, is not the part of the challenge. The challenge is to do it in time complexity of less than $O(N^2)$.

### Approach 1: Binary Search

Since the array is sorted, we notice that if `arr[i] / arr[j]` is smaller than the given fraction, then all subsequent fractions formed by `arr[i] / arr[k]` where `k > j` will also be smaller than the given fraction.

If we apply the above strategy, the fractions formed by dividing elements at different indices in the sorted array will maintain their sorted order. This enables us to efficiently solve the problem using binary search.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(self, arr, k):
        n = len(arr)
        left, right = 0, 1.0
        
        # Binary search for finding the kth smallest prime fraction
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the middle value
            mid = (left + right) / 2
            # Initialize variables to keep track of maximum fraction and indices
            max_fraction = 0.0
            total_smaller_fractions = 0
            numerator_idx, denominator_idx = 0, 0
            j = 1   # starts from 1 because arr[0] is 1
            
            # Iterate through the array to find fractions smaller than mid
            for i in range(n - 1):
                while j < n and arr[i] >= mid * arr[j]:
                    j += 1

                # Count smaller fractions
                total_smaller_fractions += (n - j)

                # If we have exhausted the array, break
                if j == n:
                    break

                # Calculate the fraction
                fraction = arr[i] / arr[j]

                # Update max_fraction and indices if necessary
                if fraction > max_fraction:
                    numerator_idx = i
                    denominator_idx = j
                    max_fraction = fraction

            # Check if we have found the kth smallest prime fraction
            if total_smaller_fractions == k:
                return [arr[numerator_idx], arr[denominator_idx]]
            elif total_smaller_fractions > k:
                right = mid  # Adjust the range for binary search
            else:
                left = mid  # Adjust the range for binary search
                
        return []  # Return empty list if kth smallest prime fraction not found
```

I cannot understand this approach for now. I might have to come back later.
