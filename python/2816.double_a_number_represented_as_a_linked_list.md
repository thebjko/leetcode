# [2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-07)

You are given the `head` of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

Return the `head` of the linked list after doubling it.

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        def dfs(node):
            if node.next is None:
                div, mod = divmod(node.val*2, 10)
                node.val = mod
                return div
            
            div = dfs(node.next)
            div, mod = divmod(node.val*2+div, 10)
            node.val = mod
            return div

        div = dfs(head)
        return ListNode(div, head) if div else head
```

## Solutions from Editorial

Solutions from editorial uses reversion, stack and recursion. I take notes on reversion and stack.

### Approach 1: Reversion

```python
class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Reverse the linked list
        reversed_list = self.reverse_list(head)
        # Initialize variables to track carry and previous node
        carry = 0
        current, previous = reversed_list, None

        # Traverse the reversed linked list
        while current:
            # Calculate the new value for the current node
            new_value = current.val * 2 + carry
            # Update the current node's value
            current.val = new_value % 10
            # Update carry for the next iteration
            carry = 1 if new_value > 9 else 0
            # Move to the next node
            previous, current = current, current.next

        # If there's a carry after the loop, add an extra node
        if carry:
            previous.next = ListNode(carry)

        # Reverse the list again to get the original order
        result = self.reverse_list(reversed_list)

        return result

    # Method to reverse the linked list
    def reverse_list(self, node: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        previous, current = None, node

        # Traverse the original linked list
        while current:
            # Store the next node
            next_node = current.next
            # Reverse the link
            current.next = previous
            # Move to the next nodes
            previous, current = current, next_node

        # Previous becomes the new head of the reversed list
        return previous
```

After reversing the given list, we traverse from the back to the front. During traversal, we go through the calculation and then reverse again to return the list in original order.

### Approach 2: Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def doubleIt(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Initialize an empty list to store the values of the linked list
        values = []
        val = 0

        # Traverse the linked list and push its values onto the list
        while head is not None:
            values.append(head.val)
            head = head.next

        new_tail = None

        # Iterate over the list of values and the carryover
        while values or val != 0:
            # Create a new ListNode with value 0 and the previous tail as its next node
            new_tail = ListNode(0, new_tail)

            # Calculate the new value for the current node
            # by doubling the last digit, adding carry, and getting the remainder
            if values:
                val += values.pop() * 2
            new_tail.val = val % 10
            val //= 10

        # Return the tail of the new linked list
        return new_tail
```

This approach utilizes stack to traverse the list from back to front.
