# [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-07)

Get the middle node of the linked list. If there are two, return the second one.

## My Solution

It was easy to think of a solution after the last day's problem(tortoise and hare algorithm for checking if cycle exists).

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        fast = slow = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow

```
