### Approach 1: Boolean Array

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        seen = [False] * (n + 1)

        for num in nums:
            if 0 < num <= n:
                seen[num] = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not seen[i]:
                return i

        return n + 1
```

This approach does not meet the constraint of the problem. However, this is included to make the solution accessible.

### Approach 2: Index as Hash Key

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        contains_1 = False

        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num == 1:
                contains_1 = True
            if num <= 0 or num > n:
                nums[idx] = 1
        
        if not contains_1:
            return 1

        for num in nums:
            val = abs(num)
            if val == n:
                nums[0] = -abs(nums[0])
            else:
                nums[val] = -abs(nums[val])

        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                return i

        if nums[0] > 0:
            return n

        return n + 1
```

Instead of `seen` table as in the previous approach, this uses the given `nums` to mark if a number exists. This consists of three iterations:

1. Check if 1 is in the list and substitute inappropriate values with 1.
2. For any element(say, `x`) in proper range(`[0, n)`), mark `nums[x]` as negative. At index 0, the information about the greatest possible integer(`n`) is stored.
3. Return index if its value is not marked as negative.

> Notice how the task is broken down.

### Approach 3. Cycle Sort

#cyclic_sort #cycle_sort

Cyclic sort is a sorting algorithm that can sort a given sequence in a range from `a` to `n` by putting each element at the index that corresponds to its value. `num` is 0-indexed array, so an element with value `x` will be located at index `x - 1`. After sorting, we iterate through `nums`, and return the first element that is not equal to its index plus one.

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

		# cyclic sort
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if 0 < nums[i] <= n and nums[i] != nums[j]:
                # swap
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1

        for i, n in enumerate(nums, 1):
            if n != i:
                return i
        
        return n + 1
```
