# [787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-23)

Return the cheapest price to get from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for a, b, c in flights:
            graph[a].append((b, c))
        
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        dist[src] = 0

        q = [(src, 0)]   # node, cost

        def bfs(q, dst, stops):
            if stops > k:
                return dist[dst] if dist[dst] != float('inf') else -1
            q2 = []
            while q:
                node, cost = q.pop()
                for next_node, next_cost in graph[node]:
                    next_cost += cost
                    if next_cost >= dist[next_node]:
                        continue
                    dist[next_node] = next_cost
                    q2.append((next_node, next_cost))
            
            return bfs(q2, dst, stops+1)

        return bfs(q, dst, 0)

```

I was able to solve it after [MarkSPhilip31's BFS](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/solutions/4769856/beats-98-users-c-java-python-javascript-explained).

I used recursive bfs to note the depth of traversal(`stops`). As I traversed, it marked distance on a separate table, instead of marking it directly as a node's information.

MarkSPhilip31 used `Queue` which is a synchronized queue for multiprocessing.

## tanmaysankhe's Dijkstra

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        
        D = defaultdict(set)
        for s,d,p in flights:
            D[s].add((d,p))
        seen = defaultdict(lambda:-2) # how many stops we already used when visited a node
        heap = [(0, src, k)] # price, curnode, remaining stop count
        while heap:
            price, cur, k = heappop(heap)
            if cur == dst:
                return price
            if seen[cur] > k or k < 0: # 1:when visited cur earlier, did we have more remaining stops than now,  2: have we exhausted all the stops this time
                continue
            seen[cur] = k
            for d,p in D[cur]:
                heappush(heap, (price+p,d,k-1))
        return -1

```

Notice how he used `defaultdict`. 

Whenever he visits a node, he marks how many stops are left(`k`) until he finds `dst`. Next time he visits the same node again, he checks if more `k` is left last time or if he can't go further this time. If these are the case, he continues to the next loop.
