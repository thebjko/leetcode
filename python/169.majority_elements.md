# [169. Majority Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-12)

> In the given list of numbers, return one that occurs more than `n/2` times.


## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        result = 0
        temp = -1
        for k, v in counter.items():
            if v > temp:
                temp = v
                result = k
        return result
```

> This was quite easy, because I could count all the numbers and returns its maximum count. But the challenge was to do the task in space of `O(1)`.

## [Moore's Voting Algorithm](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/solutions/4713694/beats-100-users-c-java-python-javascript-2-approaches-explained/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-12)

This is to do the task in space of `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        element = 0

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                element = num
                count = 1
            elif element == num:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1

        return element
```

1. Declare `count` and `element` variables.
2. As we loop through, add 1 to count if the current element is same as what is on the `element` variable, and subtract if not.

This will work, because we are trying to find the element whose count is more than `n/2`. Say you have `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1]`. Whenever `count` is `0`, `element` will change. So, in this list, until the second to the last element, `element` is 2. However, as you reach the second to the last, `element` will hold 1.

If the element has count more than or equal to 0, the answer is correct, and it will always be the case, because it is given contition.

> Think of it as a game, where many groups are fighting for the throne.
Each group has its own army. Any soldier can kill other groupâ€™s
soldier only by suicidal attack. Now no matter who ever fights
with whom, or how it starts, the one with more than half will
always win. In worst half case, every group is aiming for
the biggest group and nobody wins.
