# 2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `minK` and `maxK`.

A fixed-bound subarray of `nums` is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

- The minimum value in the subarray is equal to `minK`.
- The maximum value in the subarray is equal to `maxK`.

Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

## Solution from Editorial

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], minK: int, maxK: int) -> int:
        answer = 0
        min_position = max_position = left_bound = -1
        
        # Iterate over nums, for each number at index i:
        for i, number in enumerate(nums):
            if number < minK or number > maxK:
                left_bound = i
                
            if number == minK:
                min_position = i
            if number == maxK:
                max_position = i

            answer += max(0, min(min_position, max_position) - left_bound)
            
        return answer
```

The point is to count at index `i`, how many subarrays are valid. To do so, we keep three variables. `left_bound` is the most recent value that makes subarray invalid. `min_position` is the most recent index where `minK` is, and `max_position` is the most recent index where `maxK` is.

Because any valid subarray contains `minK` and `maxK`, add minimum index of those minus left bound to get the number of subarrays.

This is hard problem easily sovled. Amazing.
