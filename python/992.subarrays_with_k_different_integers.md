# [992. Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-30)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.

A good array is an array where the number of different integers in that array is exactly `k`.

- For example, `[1,2,3,1,2]` has `3` different integers: `1`, `2`, and `3`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

> Subarray problems are still hard to me, while I am not quite accustomed to two pointers(sliding window in this case), which makes this problem even harder.

### Approach 1: Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysWithKDistinct(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        return self.slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k) - self.slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k - 1)

    # Helper function to count the number of subarrays with at most k distinct elements.
    def slidingWindowAtMost(self, nums: List[int], distinctK: int) -> int:
        # To store the occurrences of each element.
        freq_map = defaultdict(int)
        left = 0
        total_count  = 0

        # Right pointer of the sliding window iterates through the array.
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            freq_map[nums[right]] += 1

            # If the number of distinct elements in the window exceeds k,
            # we shrink the window from the left until we have at most k distinct elements.
            while len(freq_map) > distinctK:
                freq_map[nums[left]] -= 1
                if freq_map[nums[left]] == 0:
                    del freq_map[nums[left]]
                left += 1

            # Update the total count by adding the length of the current subarray.
            total_count  += right - left + 1

        return total_count 
```


### Approach 2: Sliding Window in One Pass

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysWithKDistinct(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Dictionary to store the count of distinct values encountered
        distinct_count = defaultdict(int)

        total_count = 0
        left = 0
        right = 0
        curr_count = 0

        while right < len(nums):
            # Increment the count of the current element in the window
            distinct_count[nums[right]] += 1

            # If encountering a new distinct element, decrement K
            if distinct_count[nums[right]] == 1:
                k -= 1

            # If K becomes negative, adjust the window from the left
            if k < 0:
                # Move the left pointer until the count of distinct elements becomes valid again
                distinct_count[nums[left]] -= 1
                if distinct_count[nums[left]] == 0:
                    k += 1
                left += 1
                curr_count = 0

            # If K becomes zero, calculate subarrays
            if k == 0:
                # While the count of left remains greater than 1, keep shrinking the window from the left
                while distinct_count[nums[left]] > 1:
                    distinct_count[nums[left]] -= 1
                    left += 1
                    curr_count += 1
                # Add the count of subarrays with K distinct elements to the total count
                total_count += (curr_count + 1)

            # Move the right pointer to expand the window
            right += 1

        return total_count
```

I found the second approach more intuitive.
