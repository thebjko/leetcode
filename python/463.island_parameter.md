# [463. Island Parameter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-18)

You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    stack.append((i, j))
                    grid[i][j] = -1
                    return self.dfs(stack, grid)

    def dfs(self, stack: List[Tuple[int, int]], grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        perimeter = 0
        while stack:
            x, y = stack.pop()
            for a, b in [(x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x-1, y), (x, y-1)]:
                if 0 <= a < len(grid) and 0 <= b < len(grid[0]):
                    if grid[a][b] == 0:
                        perimeter += 1
                    elif grid[a][b] != -1:
                        stack.append((a, b))
                        grid[a][b] = -1
                else:
                    perimeter += 1
        return perimeter
```

Graph problem with little bit of tweak to it.

## Other Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        perimeter = 0

        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    perimeter += 4
                    if c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2
                    if r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == 1:
                        perimeter -= 2

        return perimeter
```

For each land, it starts with adding perimeter of 4, then subtracts if a side is connected to another land. But why 2?

First, it starts from  coordinates `(0, 0)`, that it begins with perimeter of 4. Then, say `(0, 1)` is another ground. Since `(0, 0)` is a land that we visited, we subtract 2 to perimeter to make each of the land discard the side that they are adjacent. This will give us perimeter 6.

```python
grounds = [
   [1, 1, 0],
   [0, 0, 0],
]   # perimeter 6
```

We do the same thing for other adjacent ground if exists.
