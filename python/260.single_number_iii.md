# [260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-31)

Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

## Solution from Editorial

### [Approach 2: Two Bitmasks](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-31#approach-2-two-bitmasks)

### Prerequisite

- If one builds an array bitmask with the help of the XOR operator, following `bitmask ^= x` strategy, the bitmask would keep only the bits that appear odd number of times. That was discussed in detail in the article [Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/articles/single-number-ii/).
- `x & (-x)` is a way to isolate the rightmost 1-bit, since `-x = ~x + 1`, i.e. to keep the rightmost 1-bit and to set all the other bits to zero. Please refer to the article [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/articles/power-of-two/) for a detailed explanation.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: int) -> List[int]:
        # difference between two numbers (x and y) which were seen only once
        bitmask = 0
        for num in nums:
            bitmask ^= num
        
        # rightmost 1-bit diff between x and y
        diff = bitmask & (-bitmask)
        
        x = 0
        for num in nums:
            # bitmask which will contain only x
            if num & diff:
                x ^= num
        
        return [x, bitmask^x]
```

Amazing explanation, which for now I can't understand fully. #more_to_learn
