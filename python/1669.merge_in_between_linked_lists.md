# [1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-20)

Two linked lists are given. Remove `list1`'s nodes from `a`-th to `b`-th nodes and put `list2` in their place.

## My  Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeInBetween(self, list1: ListNode, a: int, b: int, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        temp = list1
        prev = ListNode(0, temp)
        cnt = 0
        while cnt < b:
            temp = temp.next
            cnt += 1
            if cnt > b - a:
                prev = prev.next

        prev.next = list2
        while list2.next:
            list2 = list2.next

        list2.next = temp.next
        return list1
```

This approach implements two pointers. Time complexity is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(n)`.

### [DevOgabek's Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/solutions/4898944/beat-97-13-full-explanation)

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeInBetween(self, list1: ListNode, a: int, b: int, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        ptr = list1
        for _ in range(a - 1):
            ptr = ptr.next
        
        qtr = ptr.next
        for _ in range(b - a + 1):
            qtr = qtr.next
        
        ptr.next = list2
        while list2.next:
            list2 = list2.next
        list2.next = qtr
        
        return list1
```

This approach also implements two pointers. However, instead of declaring a dummy node as slow pointer, it arranges range adequately.
