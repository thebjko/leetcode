### Approach 2: Dynamic Programming - Better Brute Force on Histograms

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        dp = [[0] * len(matrix[0]) for _ in range(len(matrix))]
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                if matrix[i][j] == '0':
                    continue
                width = dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1 if j else 1
                for k in range(i, -1, -1):
                    width = min(width, dp[k][j])
                    max_area = max(max_area, width*(i-k+1))
        return max_area
```

This approach can be broken into few steps:
1. Calculates width until at each point(`width = dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1 if j else 1`)
2. Then at each column index `j`, calculates max area in the innermost for loop.

In the innermost for loop, we iterate from `i` (current height from 0) to 0. During the iteration, width is the minimum of the possible width until the current point, and we get max area with width and `i-k+1`, which is the actual height.

Time complexity is `O(N**2*M)`, `N` being height and `M` width. Space complexity is `O(NM)`.

### Approach 3: Using Histogram - Stack

```python

```

This approach borrows [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)'s fastest stack algorithm. 

So for this, I will come back after studying that algorithm.
