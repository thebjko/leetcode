# [525. Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-16)

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of `0` and `1`.

## Solution from Editorial

### Approach 1: Using Extra Array

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        int[] arr = new int[2 * nums.length + 1];
        Arrays.fill(arr, -2);
        arr[nums.length] = -1;
        int maxlen = 0, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            count = count + (nums[i] == 0 ? -1 : 1);
            if (arr[count + nums.length] >= -1) {
                maxlen = Math.max(maxlen, i - arr[count + nums.length]);
            } else {
                arr[count + nums.length] = i;
            }
        }
        return maxlen;
    }
}
```

With its python version:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        arr = [-2] * (2*n+1)
        arr[n] = -1
        maxlen = count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            count += 1 if nums[i] else -1
            if arr[count + n] >= -1:
                maxlen = max(maxlen, i - arr[count + n])
            else:
                arr[count + n] = i
        return maxlen
```
#### Analysis

1. `count` variable is incremented by one for every 1 encountered, and decremented by one for every 0. 
2. As we traverse `nums` from the beginning, if at any moment the `count` becomes zero, it implies that we've encountered equal number of zeros and once from the beginning till the current index of the `nums[i]`.
3. Furthermore, every equal elements in `arr` implies the equal number of ones and zeros between the indices corresponding to the equal `count` variable.
4. Since `count` can range from `-n` to `n`, the size of `arr` is `2n+1`.

> [To find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s, we can use the concept of prefix sum. Whenever we encounter a 0, we decrement the sum by 1, and whenever we encounter a 1, we increment the sum by 1. If the prefix sum at two indices is the same, it means that the number of 0s and 1s between those two indices is the same. We store these prefix sums along with their indices in a hash map. Then, for each prefix sum encountered, we check if we have seen this sum before. If so, it means that the subarray between the current index and the index where this sum was last encountered has an equal number of 0s and 1s. We calculate the length of this subarray and update the maximum length accordingly.](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/solutions/4881359/easy-explanation-hashmap-beats-93-29-c-java-python3-kotlin)
### Approach 2: Hash Map

This approach uses the same principle as above, but uses hash map instead of array.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hash_map = {0: -1}
        maxlen = count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            count += 1 if nums[i] else -1
            if count in hash_map:
                maxlen = max(maxlen, i - hash_map[count])
            else:
                hash_map[count] = i
        return maxlen
```

This code might be easier to understand:

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mp = {}
        sum_val = 0
        max_len = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            sum_val += 1 if num == 1 else -1
            if sum_val == 0:
                max_len = i + 1
            elif sum_val in mp:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - mp[sum_val])
            else:
                mp[sum_val] = i
        return max_len
```
