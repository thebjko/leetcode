# [310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-23)

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` edges where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.

### Approach 1: Topological Sorting

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if n <= 2:
            return [i for i in range(n)]
        
        neighbors = [set() for i in range(n)]
        for start, end in edges:
            neighbors[start].add(end)
            neighbors[end].add(start)
        
        leaves = []
        for i in range(n):
            if len(neighbors[i]) == 1:
                leaves.append(i)
        
        remaining_nodes = n
        while remaining_nodes > 2:
            remaining_nodes -= len(leaves)
            new_leaves = []
            while leaves:
                leaf = leaves.pop()
                neighbor = neighbors[leaf].pop()
                neighbors[neighbor].remove(leaf)
                if len(neighbors[neighbor]) == 1:
                    new_leaves.append(neighbor)
            leaves = new_leaves
        return leaves

```

Tree can have any of its node as its root and still be a tree. Here, we strive to find the graph's center, or ***centroids*** and consider them as the tree's root. The centroids can be no more than 2 in tree-alike graph. Suppose that we have 3 centroids in the graph, if we remove all the non-centroids nodes in the graph, then 3 centroids nodes must from a triangle shape, since they should be linked.

#### Analysis

We remove leaves until we end up with centroids.
