# [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-02)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with $O(1)$ extra memory.

## My Solution: Two Pointer

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(s)
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
```

## Other Solution

```python
with open("user.out", "w") as f:
    for case in stdin:
        f.write(f"{dumps(loads(case.strip())[::-1]).replace(', ', ',')}\n")
exit()
```
