# [2092. Find All People With Secret](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-people-with-secret/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-24)

Secret starts to spread from `0` and `firstPerson`. It spreads in meeting. Who will know this secret at the end?

# Solutions

## Approach 1: Breath First Search

```python
inf = float('inf')

class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]], firstPerson: int) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b, t in meetings:
            graph[a].append((t, b))
            graph[b].append((t, a))
        
        earliest = [inf] * n
        earliest[0] = 0
        earliest[firstPerson] = 0

        q = deque([(0, 0), (firstPerson, 0)])

        while q:
            person, time = q.popleft()
            for t, next_person in graph[person]:
                if t >= time and earliest[next_person] > t:
                    earliest[next_person] = t
                    q.append((next_person, t))
        
        return [i for i in range(n) if earliest[i] != inf]

```

Note graph and how time is checked in the iteration. Since the meeting occurs along the time, `next_person` is only appended only if `t` is greater than equal to `time`. At the end of iteration, `earliest` will hold the information when they get to know the secret.

## Approach 2: Depth First Search

It actually does not matter to use bfs or dfs, since it has to traverse over the entire graph. So, I will skip this part.

## Approach 3: Earliest Informed First Traversal

At this time, we are trying to process each node once using priority queue.

```python
inf = float('inf')

class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]], firstPerson: int) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b, t in meetings:
            graph[a].append((t, b))
            graph[b].append((t, a))
        
        heapify(pq := [(0, 0), (0, firstPerson)])
        visited = [False] * n

        while pq:
            time, person = heappop(pq)   # in the order of time
            if visited[person]:
                continue
            visited[person] = True
            for t, next_person in graph[person]:
                if not visited[next_person] and t >= time:
                    heappush(pq, (t, next_person))
        
        return [i for i in range(n) if visited[i]]

```

The most challenging part for me is to understand condition in the for loop. Since it is using priority queue, it proceeds each node for the first time. Start from `0` and `firstPerson`. Then iterate over other people who have meeting with them. For each of them, next people with whom they will have meeting will be pushed into the queue. Disregard anyone who has meeting before they know the secret(`t >= time`).

## Approach 4: BFS on Time Scale

```python
ig = itemgetter

class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]], firstPerson: int) -> List[int]:
        same_time_meetings = defaultdict(list)
        for *pair, t in sorted(meetings, key=ig(2)):
            same_time_meetings[t].append(pair)

        confidants = [False] * n
        confidants[0] = True
        confidants[firstPerson] = True

        for t, ls in same_time_meetings.items():
            meet = defaultdict(list)
            for a, b in ls:
                meet[a].append(b)
                meet[b].append(a)

            q = set()
            for a, b in ls:
                if confidants[a]:
                    q.add(a)
                if confidants[b]:
                    q.add(b)

            q = deque(q)
            while q:
                person = q.popleft()
                for next_person in meet[person]:
                    if not confidants[next_person]:
                        confidants[next_person] = True
                        q.append(next_person)                        
            
        return [i for i in range(n) if confidants[i]]

```

Iterate in the order of time. As time goes, anyone who are in the meeting with confidant becomes confidant.

## Approach 5: Union-Find with Reset

This approach aims to find connectedness of the graph at a particular time.

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]], firstPerson: int) -> List[int]:
        # Sort meetings in increasing order of time
        meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

        # Group Meetings in increasing order of time
        same_time_meetings = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y, t in meetings:
            same_time_meetings[t].append((x, y))
    
        # Create graph
        graph = UnionFind(n)
        graph.unite(firstPerson, 0)

        # Process in increasing order of time
        for t in same_time_meetings:
            # Unite two persons taking part in a meeting
            for x, y in same_time_meetings[t]:
                graph.unite(x, y)
            
            # If any one knows the secret, both will be connected to 0.
            # If no one knows the secret, then reset.
            for x, y in same_time_meetings[t]:
                if not graph.connected(x, 0):
                    # No need to check for y since x and y were united
                    graph.reset(x)
                    graph.reset(y)
        
        # Al those who are connected to 0 will know the secret
        return [i for i in range(n) if graph.connected(i, 0)]

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, nodes: int):
        # Initialize parent and rank arrays
        self.parent = [i for i in range(nodes)]
        self.rank = [0] * nodes

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        # Find the parent of node x. Use Path Compression
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def unite(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        # Unite two nodes x and y, if they are not already united
        px = self.find(x)
        py = self.find(y)
        if px != py:
            # Union by Rank Heuristic
            if self.rank[px] > self.rank[py]:
                self.parent[py] = px
            elif self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
                self.parent[px] = py
            else:
                self.parent[py] = px
                self.rank[px] += 1
    
    def connected(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
        # Check if two nodes x and y are connected or not
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)
    
    def reset(self, x: int) -> None:
        # Reset the initial properties of node x
        self.parent[x] = x
        self.rank[x] = 0

```
