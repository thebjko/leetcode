# [1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-deleting-similar-ends/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-05)

## Approach 1: Two Pointers

### Iterative Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        while l < r and s[l] == s[r]:
            char = s[l]

            while l <= r and s[l] == char:
                l += 1
            while l < r and s[r] == char:
                r -= 1

        return r - l + 1

```

It is hard for me to grasp how to set the termination condition for two pointers. Editorial explains when to stop iteration:

1. When `s[l]` is different from `s[r]`. This is applied to the outer `while` loop.
2. When `l` is equal to `r`. This case means that one character is left: all similar ends have been deleted. This rule is applied to the outher `while` loop and the second inner `while` loop.
3. When `l` is greater than `r`. The whole string is processed. See the first loop of the inner `while` loop.

We can terminate the outer iteration if one character is left. Otherwise, we proceeds to delete prefix while `l` is not greater than `r`. If `l` becomes greater than `r`, there's no need to proceed to the next `while` loop.

For example, say we have `"abbcbaa"`. In phase 1, `a`'s are deleted. In phase 2, `b`'s are deleted and both `l` and `r` points to `c` and the outher `while` loop breaks.

But in the case of `"abbccbaa"`, we move on to the next phase. In phase 3, in the first inner loop, `l` moves from 3 to 5 while `r` is 4.

For `"abbccdbaa"`, the third phase does not take place because `l` is pointing to `c` and `r` is point to `d` which are not equal: the outer loop breaks. At this point, the condition `l < r` doesn't have to be that. So I tested `l <= r` and it worked.


## Approach 2: Tail Recursion

### My Attempt

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        if len(s) <= 1 or s[0] != s[-1]:
            return len(s)

        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1
        char = s[l]
        while l < len(s) and s[l] == char:
            l += 1
        while r >= 0 and s[r] == char:
            r -= 1

        return self.minimumLength(s[l:r+1])

```

This is my attempt which exceeded memory limit. Editorial solution solves this issue by not copying `s` like I did(`s[l:r+1]`) but instead taking the original string with pointers.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        return self.delete_similar_ends(s, 0, len(s) - 1)

    # Deletes similar ends and returns remaining length
    def delete_similar_ends(self, s: str, begin: int, end: int) -> int:
        # The ends differ or meet in the middle
        if begin >= end or s[begin] != s[end]:
            return end - begin + 1
        else:
            c = s[begin]
            
            # Delete consecutive occurrences of c from prefix
            while begin <= end and s[begin] == c:
                begin += 1

            # Delete consecutive occurrences of c from suffix
            while end > begin and s[end] == c:
                end -= 1

            return self.delete_similar_ends(s, begin, end)

```
