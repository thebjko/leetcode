# [57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-17)

Given an array of non-overlapping intervals and `newInterval`, return an array after inserting `newInterval` into the array without overlap, sorted in order.

### Approach 1: Linear Search

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []
        i = 0
        n = len(intervals)

        while i < n and intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]:
            ans.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1
        
        while i < n and newInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]:
            newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0])
            newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])
            i += 1
        ans.append(newInterval)

        while i < n:
            ans.append(intervals[i])
            i += 1

        return ans
```

This problem is easier to solve after ["Merge Interval"](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/). This approach breaks down the problem into three cases:

1. The current interval ends before the new interval starts.
2. There is an overlap, and the intervals need merging.
3. The current interval starts after the new interval ends.

The above code deals with these cases with three while loops. During the first while loop, each pair is ended before `newInterval` starts, which means there is no overlap. So they are appended to `ans`.

During the second while loop, each interval begins before `newInterval`. Therefore, they need merging. Thus `newInterval` is modified such that its beginning is the minimum of itself and that which is compared, and its end is the maximum of itself and that which is compared.

The rest is appended to `ans`.

### Approach 3: Binary Search

This approach implements binary search for `newInterval`'s insertion.

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not intervals:
            return [newInterval]

        n = len(intervals)
        target = newInterval[0]
        left, right = 0, n-1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if intervals[mid][0] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        intervals.insert(left, newInterval)

        ans = []
        for interval in intervals:
            if not ans or ans[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                ans.append(interval)
            else:
                ans[-1][1] = max(ans[-1][1], interval[1])
        return ans
```
