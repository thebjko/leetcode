# [2441. Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-positive-integer-that-exists-with-its-negative/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-02)

Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zeros, find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array.

Return the positive integer `k`. If there is no such integer, return `-1`.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        s = set(nums)
        res = -1
        for n in nums:
            if n > res and -n in s:
                res = n
        return res
```

This is a two-pass hash set approach. In the approach 3 of editorial which I do not take note on, set keeps only negative numbers.

### Approach 2: Two Pointer
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort the input list in ascending order
        nums.sort()

        lo = 0
        hi = len(nums) - 1

        while lo < hi:

            # If the negation of the element at lo is equal to the element at hi
            if -nums[lo] == nums[hi]:
                return nums[hi]

            # If the negation of element at lo is greater than element at hi
            elif -nums[lo] > nums[hi]: 
                lo += 1

            # If the negation of element at lo is smaller than element at hi
            else:
                hi -= 1

        return -1
```

This approach has time complexity of $O(n * \log n)$.

On space complexity:

- In Python, the `sort` method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has $O(n)$ additional space.
- In C++, the `sort()` function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of $O(\log n)$.
- In Java, `Arrays.sort()` is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of $O(\log ⁡n)$ for sorting two arrays.

### Approach 4: One Pass Hash Set

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = -1

        # A set to store seen numbers
        seen = set()

        for num in nums:
            abs_num = abs(num)

            # If the absolute value is greater than the current maximum and its negation is seen
            if abs_num > ans and -num in seen:
                ans = abs_num
            seen.add(num)  # Insert the current number into the set

        return ans
```

My approach can be improved like this.
