# [752. Open the Lock](https://leetcode.com/problems/open-the-lock/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-22)

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots:` '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'`. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn `'9'` to be `'0'`, or `'0'` to be `'9'`. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at `'0000'`, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of `deadends` dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a `target` representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

## My Attempt

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        hq = [(0, "0000")]
        deadends = set(deadends)
        visited = set()
        chars = [chr(i) for i in range(48, 58)]
        while hq:
            turn, cur = heappop(hq)
            if cur == target:
                return turn
            if cur in deadends:
                continue
            visited.add(cur)
            cur = list(map(int, cur))
            for i, c in enumerate(cur):
                cur[i] = chars[(c+1)%10]
                if (x:=''.join(map(str, cur))) not in visited:
                    heappush(hq, (turn+1, x))
                cur[i] = chars[(c+9)%10]
                if (x:=''.join(map(str, cur))) not in visited:
                    heappush(hq, (turn+1, x))
                cur[i] = c

        return -1
```

I tried to solve it with Djikstra. MLE.

## Solution from Editorial

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        deadends = set(deadends)
        pending = deque()
        chars = [i for i in range(10)]
        turns = 0
        if "0000" in deadends:
            return -1
        
        pending.append("0000")
        deadends.add("0000")
        
        while pending:
            cur_nodes_count = len(pending)
            for _ in range(cur_nodes_count):
                cur_comb = pending.popleft()
                if cur_comb == target:
                    return turns
                for i, cur in enumerate(cur_comb):
                    new_comb = list(map(int, cur_comb))
                    new_comb[i] = chars[(new_comb[i]+1)%10]
                    if (x:=''.join(map(str, new_comb))) not in deadends:
                        pending.append(x)
                        deadends.add(x)
                    new_comb[i] = chars[(new_comb[i]+8)%10]
                    if (x:=''.join(map(str, new_comb))) not in deadends:
                        pending.append(x)
                        deadends.add(x)
            turns += 1

        return -1
```

It turns out to be more efficient to use BFS in this case, because BFS searches the graph level by level. Note the technique to distinguish each level: it does not keep records in tuple like I would have done(e.g. `(level, node)`).
