# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-15)

Return an array of integer such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of the rest.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        left = [1] * n
        right = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            left[i] = left[i-1] * nums[i-1]
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            left[i] *= right
            right *= nums[i]

        return left
```

### Analysis
Each element of the result array(`left` in the above case) can be divided into two parts: left and right. Left consists of the product of numbers that are on the left side of current element, and the right consists of those are on the right side. And the products of the numbers with same index are the element of the answer array.

The above code improved this algorithm further. Instead of declaring `right` as array, `right` is declared as a variable. Then through the iteration (the second for loop), `right` is multiplied to each element of `left`.

This can be improved further:

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        ans = [1] * n
        left = 1
        
        # Calculate product of elements to the left
        for i in range(n):
            ans[i] *= left
            left *= nums[i]
        
        right = 1
        
        # Calculate product of elements to the right
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            ans[i] *= right
            right *= nums[i]
        
        return ans
```

This code declared `left` as a variable, too. With `ans`, an array of 1's, it multiplies `left` through the forward iteration, and `right` through the backward iteration. Brilliant.

In this case time complexity is `O(n)` because it iterates the `nums` array, and **extra** space complexity is `O(1)` because through the whole process, only two variable `left`  and `right` is maintained. With `ans`, of course the space complexity is `O(n)`.
