# [1992. Find All Groups of Farmland](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-groups-of-farmland/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-20)

You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `land` where a `0` represents a hectare of forested land and a `1` represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above fro each group of farmland in `land`. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in any order.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findFarmland(self, land: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        output = []
        for i, row in enumerate(land):
            for j, cell in enumerate(row):
                if cell:
                    land[i][j] = 0
                    stack = [(i, j)]
                    max_x, max_y = j, i
                    while stack:
                        y, x = stack.pop()
                        a, b = y + 1, x + 1
                        if a < len(land) and land[a][x]:
                            stack.append((a, x))
                            land[a][x] = 0
                            max_y = a
                        if b < len(row) and land[y][b]:
                            stack.append((y, b))
                            land[y][b] = 0
                            max_x = b

                    output.append([i, j, max_y, max_x])
        return output
```

Time complexity and space complexity of `O(N)`.

## Other Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findFarmland(self, land: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n, res = len(land), len(land[0]), []
        for i in range(m):
            j = 0
            while j < n:
                if land[i][j]:
                    if land[i][j] == 1:
                        k, l = j+1, i+1
                        while k < n and land[i][k]==1:
	                        k += 1
                        k += 1
                        while l < m and land[l][j]==1:
                            land[l][j] = -k
                            l += 1
                        if l < m:
                            land[l][j] = 1-k
                        res.append([i,j,l-1,k-2])
                        j = k
                    else:
                        j = -land[i][j]
                else:
                    j += 1
        return res
```

Notable approach. It does not use dfs. Instead, it looks more similar to two pointers.
