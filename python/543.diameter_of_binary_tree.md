# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-27)

The diameter of a binary tree is the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.get_max_depth(root)
        stack = [root]
        answer = 0
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            answer = max(answer, node.diameter_of_subtree)
            for next_node in (node.left, node.right):
                if next_node:
                    stack.append(next_node)
        return answer

    def get_max_depth(self, node: TreeNode):
        left = self.get_max_depth(node.left) + 1 if node.left else 0
        right = self.get_max_depth(node.right) + 1 if node.right else 0
        node.diameter_of_subtree = left + right
        node.max_depth = max(left, right)
        return node.max_depth

```

It was a hard way around. I made 2 traversals; one for depths and the other for diameter.

## Others

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            left = dfs(node.left) 
            right = dfs(node.right)
            self.res = max(self.res, left+right)
            return 1 + max(left, right)
        dfs(root)
        return self.res

```

Some people made one post-order traversal using recursive dfs. For each `dfs` call, it returns max depth for the current subtree. Then it evaluates the diameter of the current subtree(`left+right`) and other possible candidates recorded in `self.res`.
