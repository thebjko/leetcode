## Solution from Editorial

### Approach 1: Sliding Window

This editorial has amazing explanation video.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        left = right = max_length = 0
        d = {}

        while right < len(s):
            d[s[right]] = right
            if len(d) == 3:
                min_key, min_val = '', float('inf')
                for k, v in d.items():
                    if v < min_val:
                        min_key, min_val = k, v
                del d[min_key]
                left = min_val + 1
            max_length = max(max_length, right-left+1)
            right += 1

        return max_length
```

## Other Solutions

### One

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        win = {}
        left, right, ans = 0, 0, 0

        while right < len(s):
            c = s[right]
            right += 1

            if c not in win:
                win[c] = 1
            else:
                win[c] += 1

            if len(win) <= 2:
                ans = max(ans, sum(win.values()))

            while len(win) > 2:
                d = s[left]
                left += 1

                if d in win:
                    win[d] -= 1
                    if win[d] == 0:
                        del win[d]
        return ans
```

> What is `win` for? Why `sum(win.values())`?

This approach counts the number of the letters while keeping only two letters in `win`. If the length of `win` exceeds 2, the inner loop deals with the case: it increments `left` pointer until there only remains two letters in `win`.

### Two

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        count, i = {}, 0 
        for j, k in enumerate(s):
            count[k] = count.get(k, 0) + 1
            if len(count) > 2:
                count[s[i]] -= 1
                if count[s[i]] == 0:
                    del count[s[i]]
                i += 1
        return j - i + 1
```

This approach is little trickier. It also keeps the count of the letters. In this approach `i` does not keep up with `j` as `left` did with `right` in other approaches. Rather, `i` stays away from `j` to keep maximum number.

For example, let `s` be `"aaaabcd"`. `i` is at 0 until `k` reaches the letter `"c"`(thus `j` is 5). At this point the length of `count` is greater than 2, so `i` becomes 1. It does not have to be at `"b"`, because when `k` is `b`, it reaches the maximum length 5, and we want to keep it somewhere. The author does it by maintaining the distance between `i` and `j`. Amazing.
