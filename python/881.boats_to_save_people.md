# [881. Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-04)

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. `Each` boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return *the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.*

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        n = len(people)

        boats = 0
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        while l <= r:
            if people[r] > limit:
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif people[l] <= limit - people[r]:
                l += 1
            boats += 1
            r -= 1
        return boats
```

Applied what I've learned: Two pointers.

## Solution from Editorial

### Approach 1: Greedy (Two Pointer)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numRescueBoats(self, people, limit):
        people.sort()
        i, j = 0, len(people) - 1
        ans = 0
        while i <= j:
            ans += 1
            if people[i] + people[j] <= limit:
                i += 1
            j -= 1
        return ans
```

This approach also utilized two pointer, but in a more elegant way in using them in the loop. It also used the problems constraints where `people[i] <= limit`, in order to have the conditions inside the loop optimized.
