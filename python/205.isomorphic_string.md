# [205. Isomorphic String](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

Check if `s` and `t` are isomorphic. Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

## My Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        a = {}
        b = {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            a[s[i]] = t[i]
            b[t[i]] = s[i]

        r = ''
        for c in s:
            r += a[c]
        
        if r != t:
            return False
        
        q = ''
        for c in t:
            q += b[c]
        
        if q != s:
            return False

        return True
```

At first, it was difficult to grasp the meaning of the problem. Other than that, after little bit of trial, I was able to solve it easily.

### Approach 1: Character Mapping with Dictionary

```python
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        mapping_s_t = {}
        mapping_t_s = {}
        
        for c1, c2 in zip(s, t):
            if (c1 not in mapping_s_t) and (c2 not in mapping_t_s):
                mapping_s_t[c1] = c2
                mapping_t_s[c2] = c1
            elif mapping_s_t.get(c1) != c2 or mapping_t_s.get(c2) != c1:
                return False
            
        return True
```


### Approach 2: First occurrence transformation

```python
class Solution:
    
    def transformString(self, s: str) -> str:
        index_mapping = {}
        new_str = []
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in index_mapping:
                index_mapping[c] = i
            new_str.append(str(index_mapping[c]))
        
        return " ".join(new_str)
    
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return self.transformString(s) == self.transformString(t)
