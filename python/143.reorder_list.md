# [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-23)

With given linked list whose order is, say, 0 → 1 → 2 → ... → n, reorder it such that its order is 0 → n → 1 → n-1 → 2 → n-2 → ... .

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if head is None:
            return
        mid = self.get_middle_node(head)
        second_half = self.reverse(mid.next)
        mid.next = None
        self.merge(head, second_half)

    def reverse(self, node):
        prev = None
        while node:
            tmp = node
            node = tmp.next
            tmp.next = prev
            prev = tmp
        return prev

    def get_middle_node(self, node):
        slow = fast = node
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow

    def merge(self, node1, node2):
        while node1:
            nxt = node1.next
            node1.next = node2
            node1 = node2
            node2 = nxt
```

As described in editorial, this is a combination of getting middle node, reversing, and merging. Merging can be simpler as seen in 'other solution'.

## Other Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        slow, fast = head, head.next

        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        #reverse the second half
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp
        #merge two half
        first, second = head, prev

        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2

```

Just taking note of merging.
