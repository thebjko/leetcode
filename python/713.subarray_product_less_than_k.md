# 713. Subarray Product Less Than K

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

### Approach 1: Using Sliding Window

This pattern is applicable when the problem entails achieving a goal using **subarrays**, and individual elements cannot be independently selected.

```python
class Solution:
    def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if k <= 1:
            return 0

        total_count = 0
        product = 1

        left = 0

        for right, num in enumerate(nums):
            product *= num

            while product >= k:
                product //= nums[left]
                left += 1

            total_count += right - left + 1
        
        return total_count
```

#### Analysis

1. If `k` is less than or equal to 1, return 0, for no subarray can have product less than `k`.
2. Through iteration, we multiply each `num` to `product`.
	1. As `product` becomes greater than `k`, we divide on from the left.
3. Counting `right - left + 1` does the job, that is, counting the number of all possible subarrays. For example, let `num` be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and `k` be `2`. In this case, `total_count` is $\sum_{x=1}^6 x = 21$, which is the same as `right - left + 1` from 0 to 5.
