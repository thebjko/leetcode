# 2997. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

You can apply the following operation on the array **any** number of times:

- Choose any element of the array and flip a bit in its binary representation. Flipping a bit means changing a `0` to `1` or vice versa.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations required to make the bitwise **XOR** of all elements of the final array equal to* `k`.

**Note** that you can flip leading zero bits in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number <code>(101)<sub>2</sub></code> you can flip the fourth bit and obtain <code>(1101)<sub>2</sub></code>.

## Solution from Editorial

This problem requires thorough understanding on bitwise operation as we can see in [[2997.minimum_number_of_operations_to_make_array_xor_equal_to_k#Other Solution|Other Solution]].

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        final_xor = 0
        for n in nums:
            final_xor ^= n
        
        count = 0
        while k or final_xor:
            if (k % 2) != (final_xor % 2):
                count += 1
            k //= 2
            final_xor //= 2
        
        return count
```

According to the instruction, we are first to get xor of all elements in `nums`. Then we count the number of mismatches in bit between the result(`final_xor`) and `k`. While loop does the count.

## Other Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        temp = 0
        for i in nums:
            temp ^= i
        temp ^= k
        return bin(temp).count('1')   # or return temp.bit_count()
```
