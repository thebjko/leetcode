Check if given linked list is palindrome. Challenge is to do it in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        cnt = 0
        tmp = head
        while tmp:
            cnt += 1
            tmp = tmp.next
        med = cnt // 2
        prev = None
        while med:
            tmp = head
            head = head.next
            tmp.next = prev
            prev = tmp
            med -= 1
        if cnt&1 == 1:
            head = head.next
        while head and prev:
            if head.val != prev.val:
                return False
            head = head.next
            prev = prev.next
        return True
```

1. Count the number of nodes.
2. Reverse the first half.
3. Check if the rest is equal to the reversed part.

### Approach 2: Recursive

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:

        self.front_pointer = head

        def recursively_check(current_node=head):
            if current_node is not None:
                if not recursively_check(current_node.next):
                    return False
                if self.front_pointer.val != current_node.val:
                    return False
                self.front_pointer = self.front_pointer.next
            return True

        return recursively_check()
```

Although this is not of `O(1)` space complexity, this is an interesting approach. The reason why this is not `O(1)` space complexity, although it does not create extra data structure, is that recursion is put in **runtime stack** or **stack frame**.

1. The function traverses all the way down until `current_node` is `None`.
2. From backward it checks the last node's value with the first, and the next, and on and on.

### Approach 3: Reverse Second Half In-place

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if head is None:
            return True

        # Find the end of first half and reverse second half.
        first_half_end = self.end_of_first_half(head)
        second_half_start = self.reverse_list(first_half_end.next)

        # Check whether or not there's a palindrome.
        result = True
        first_position = head
        second_position = second_half_start
        while result and second_position is not None:
            if first_position.val != second_position.val:
                result = False
            first_position = first_position.next
            second_position = second_position.next

        # Restore the list and return the result.
        first_half_end.next = self.reverse_list(second_half_start)
        return result    

    def end_of_first_half(self, head):
        fast = head
        slow = head
        while fast.next is not None and fast.next.next is not None:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        return slow

    def reverse_list(self, head):
        previous = None
        current = head
        while current is not None:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = previous
            previous = current
            current = next_node
        return previous
```

1. It reverses second half.
2. Instead of using `cnt` variable, it utilizes `fast` and `slow` variables to get node at half.
