# 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

There are `n` workers. You are given two integer arrays `quality` and wage where `quality[i]` is the quality of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> worker and `wage[i]` is the minimum wage expectation for the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> worker.

We want to hire exactly `k` workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of `k` workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

- Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
- In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.

Given the integer `k`, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be accepted.

### Approach: Priority Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def mincostToHireWorkers(self, quality: List[int], wage: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        n = len(quality)
        total_cost = float("inf")
        total_qual = 0
        ratios = []

        for i in range(n):
            ratios.append((wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i]))

        ratios.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        workers = []

        for i in range(n):
            heappush(workers, -ratios[i][1])
            total_qual += ratios[i][1]
        
            if len(workers) > k:
                total_qual += heappop(workers)
            
            if len(workers) == k:
                total_cost = min(
                    total_cost, total_qual * ratios[i][0]
                )
        return total_cost
```

```python
class Solution:
    def mincostToHireWorkers(self, quality: List[int], wage: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        n = len(quality)
        total_cost = float("inf")
        total_qual = 0
        ratios = []

        for q, w in zip(quality, wage):
            ratios.append((w / q, q))

        ratios.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        workers = []

        for r, q in ratios:
            heappush(workers, -q)
            total_qual += q
        
            if len(workers) > k:
                total_qual += heappop(workers)
            
            if len(workers) == k:
                total_cost = min(
                    total_cost, total_qual * r
                )
        return total_cost
```
