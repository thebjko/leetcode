### Approach 1: Depth-First Search

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCoins(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.moves = 0

        def dfs(current):
            if current == None: return 0

            # Calculate the coins each subtree has available to exchange
            left_coins = dfs(current.left)
            right_coins = dfs(current.right)

            # Add the total number of exchanges to moves
            self.moves += abs(left_coins) + abs(right_coins)

            # The number of coins current has available to exchange
            return (current.val - 1) + left_coins + right_coins

        dfs(root)

        return self.moves
```

Coins should be distributed from leaf nodes to the top. The other way around does not work since it is difficult to grasp the shape of subtree from a node. Instead, from the bottom, count the moves required to have coins distributed properly. 

Consider the following case:

![](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/Figures/979/ExampleB.png)

The leftmost blue node with initial value of 4 sends 3 of the coins to its parent. The green one demands 1 coin (`-1`) from its parent.

Repeating this process will have the tree have coins distributed properly. In each of these processes, add to `self.moves` to keep the move counts.
