# [948. Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-04)

You have `power` to play token. You can play face-up if you have more or equal power to the value of the token. You can play face-down if you have at least one point of score, to gain power as much as the value of the token. Return the maximum possible score after playing **any** number of token.

> Note that you don't have to play token in order as well as you don't have to play them all.

## Solution

### Approach: Sort and Greedy

```python
class Solution:
    def bagOfTokensScore(self, tokens: List[int], power: int) -> int:
        tokens.sort()
        score = 0
        l, r = 0, len(tokens) - 1
        while l <= r:
            if power >= tokens[l]:
                score += 1
                power -= tokens[l]
                l += 1
            elif l < r and score > 0:
                score -= 1
                power += tokens[r]
                r -= 1
            else:
                return score
        return score

```

Since you don't have to play them in order, it is sensible to sort them in order: tokens with higher values are for increasing `power`, ones with lower values are for `score`. Then from each end to the middle, do the following steps:

1. If you can play the leftmost token face-up, do so.
2. If you can't, see if you have score so that you can add to `power` with the rightmost token.
3. If you can't do step 1 or 2, return the current score.
4. If all tokens are played, return the score.
