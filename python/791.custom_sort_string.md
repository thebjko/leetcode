# [791. Custom Sort String](https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-11)

Sort `s` in the order of `order`.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        hash_table = {j: i for i, j in enumerate(order)}
        counter = Counter(s)
        priority = dict()
        for i, j in counter.items():
            if i in hash_table:
                priority[hash_table[i]] = i * j
        
        result = ''
        for pr in sorted(priority):
            result += priority[pr]

        for char in s:
            if char not in hash_table:
                result += char

        return result

```

It is not too hard to implement what is required. Challenge is to do it efficiently.

## Other Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        counter = defaultdict(int)
        for c in s:
            counter[c] += 1

        sb = []
        for o in order:
            for i in range(counter[o]):
                sb.append(o)
            counter[o] = 0

        for key in counter:
                for i in range(counter[key]):
                    sb.append(key)
        
        return ''.join(sb)
        
```

This approach is about 4 times faster(12ms) than mine(41ms).

### Analysis

1. Count alphabets in `s`
2. Iterate over `order`. During iteration,
    1. append each character in `order` in as much as it appears in `s`
    2. reset counter to 0, in order to use what is left later
3. Append the rest
4. Return joined string
