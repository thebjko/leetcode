# [3075. Maximize Happiness of Selected Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-happiness-of-selected-children/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-09)

You are given an array `happiness` of length `n`, and a positive integer `k`.

There are `n` children standing in a queue, where the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> child has happiness value `happiness[i]`. You want to select `k` children from these `n` children in `k` turns.

In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that have not been selected till now decreases by `1`. Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and gets decremented only if it is positive.

Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by selecting `k` children.

## My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumHappinessSum(self, happiness: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        happiness.sort(reverse=True)
        ans = 0
        idx = 0
        n = len(happiness)
        while k:
            hap = happiness[idx] - idx
            if hap > 0:
                ans += hap
                idx += 1
            else:
                break
            k -= 1
        return ans
```

## Other Solutions

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumHappinessSum(self, happiness: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        children = sorted(happiness, reverse=True)

        # Fast calc if no child hits zero happiness
        # Could do binary search to see if I can do half, quarter, etc this way
        if children[k-1] >= k-1:
            return sum(children[:k]) - ((0 + k-1) * k // 2)

        # Else slow way
        res = 0
        for i, h in enumerate(children[:k]):
            if h - i <= 0:
                break
            res += h - i

        return res
```
