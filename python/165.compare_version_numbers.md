# [165. Compare Version Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-03)

Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0` < `1`.

## My Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        idx = 0
        version1 = version1.split('.')
        version2 = version2.split('.')
        while idx < len(version1) and idx < len(version2):
            v1, v2 = int(version1[idx]), int(version2[idx])
            if v1 > v2:
                return 1
            elif v1 < v2:
                return -1
            idx += 1

        if idx < len(version1) and sum(map(int, version1[idx:])):
            return 1
        elif idx < len(version2) and sum(map(int, version2[idx:])):
            return -1
        return 0
```

Implements what is required in the instruction. This is a two pass approach: one for `split` method, the other for comparison.

### Approach 1: Split + Parse, Two Pass

```python
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        nums1 = version1.split(".")
        nums2 = version2.split(".")
        n1, n2 = len(nums1), len(nums2)

        # compare versions
        for i in range(max(n1, n2)):
            i1 = int(nums1[i]) if i < n1 else 0
            i2 = int(nums2[i]) if i < n2 else 0
            if i1 != i2:
                return 1 if i1 > i2 else -1

        # The versions are equal
        return 0
```

It is worth noting how it uses range and conditions for a simpler code.

### Approach 2: Two Pointers, One Pass

```python
class Solution:
    def get_next_chunk(self, version: str, n: int, p: int) -> List[int]:
        # If pointer is set to the end of the string, return 0
        if p > n - 1:
            return 0, p

        # Find the end of the chunk
        p_end = p
        while p_end < n and version[p_end] != ".":
            p_end += 1

        # Retrieve the chunk
        i = int(version[p:p_end]) if p_end != n - 1 else int(version[p:n])

        # Find the beginning of the next chunk
        p = p_end + 1

        return i, p

    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        p1 = p2 = 0
        n1, n2 = len(version1), len(version2)

        # Compare versions
        while p1 < n1 or p2 < n2:
            i1, p1 = self.get_next_chunk(version1, n1, p1)
            i2, p2 = self.get_next_chunk(version2, n2, p2)
            if i1 != i2:
                return 1 if i1 > i2 else -1

        # The versions are equal
        return 0
```
