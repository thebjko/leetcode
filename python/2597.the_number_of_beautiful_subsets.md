# [2597. The Number of Beautiful Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-beautiful-subsets/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-23)

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and a positive integer `k`.

A subset of `nums` is beautiful if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to `k`.

Return the number of non-empty beautiful subsets of the array `nums`.

A subset of `nums` is an array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) elements from nums. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

### Approach 1: Using Bitset

A bitset is a compact way of representing a set of elements, where each bit corresponds to a single element. If the bit is set (1), it means the element is included in the set; otherwise, it is not included (0).

Example: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`, subset: `[1,3,4]`

This subset includes the elements at indices `0`, `2`, and `3`, so the corresponding mask is `001101`. The least significant bit corresponds to the element at index zero.

We traverse the elements of the array `nums`. For each element `nums[i]`, we check if including it in the current subset would make the subset ugly (i.e., if there exists a pair of elements with a difference of `k`). We can do this by checking all previously included elements in the bitset.

If the current element `nums[i]` does not make the subset ugly, we include it in the bitset by setting the corresponding bit. Otherwise, we skip it and move to the next element.

The process is visualized below:

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def beautifulSubsets(self, nums, k):
        return self._count_beautiful_subsets(nums, k, 0, 0)

    def _count_beautiful_subsets(self, nums, k, index, mask):
        # Base case: Return 1 if mask is greater than 0 (non-empty subset)
        if index == len(nums):
            return 1 if mask > 0 else 0

        # Flag to check if the current subset is beautiful
        is_beautiful = True

        # Check if the current number forms a beautiful pair with any 
        # previous number in the subset
        for j in range(index):
            if ((1 << j) & mask) == 0 or \
               abs(nums[j] - nums[index]) != k:
                continue
            else:
                is_beautiful = False
                break

        # Recursively calculate beautiful subsets including and excluding 
        # the current number
        skip = self._count_beautiful_subsets(nums, k, index + 1, mask)
        take = (
            self._count_beautiful_subsets(
                nums, k, index + 1, mask + (1 << index)
            )
            if is_beautiful
            else 0
        )

        return skip + take
```

#### Understanding Approach 1

This recursive approach goes through the array `nums` and branches out into two for each element `n`. Those two branches are `take` and `skip`. As we can see in the picture above, some of the branches are beautiful while the others are not. We count those not-beautiful cases.

Also as explained above, `take` is mark as (1) on `mask`. So when we take, `mask` becomes `mask + (1 << index)`, to mark (1) at its appropriate location on the array.

In the for loop, we iterate over the previous elements that we encountered until that point with the current number `nums[index]` using `mask`.
