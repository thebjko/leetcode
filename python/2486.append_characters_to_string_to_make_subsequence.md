# [2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-06-03)

You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

## My Solution: Two Pointer

```python
class Solution:
    def appendCharacters(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        loc1 = loc2 = 0
        n = len(s)
        m = len(t)
        while loc1 < n and loc2 < m:
            if s[loc1] == t[loc2]:
                loc1 += 1
                loc2 += 1
            else:
                loc1 += 1
        return m - loc2
```

The challenge is to implement what is required by the instruction.
