# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-21)

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        while head:
            temp = head
            head = head.next
            temp.next = prev
            prev = temp
        return prev
```

Basic linked list problem.

1. Throughout the iteration, declare `temp` to store current node.
2. Move pointer to the current node to its next.
3. The next node of the node stored in `temp` is set to `prev`.
4. Then set `prev` to `temp`, because next loop's previous node is this loop's current node.
