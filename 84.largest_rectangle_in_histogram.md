# [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/)

## Solution from Editorial

### Using Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = [-1]
        max_area = 0
        for i, height in enumerate(heights):
            while stack[-1] != -1 and heights[stack[-1]] >= height:
                current_height = heights[stack.pop()]
                current_width = i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, current_height*current_width)
            stack.append(i)

        while stack[-1] != -1:
            current_height = heights[stack.pop()]
            current_width = len(heights) - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, current_height*current_width)
        return max_area
```

Brilliant solution using stack. For each bar, get width with left and right boundaries. The heights of these boundaries are less than the current bar, so that the width multiplied with the height that is popped out of the list is the area of rectangle of current concern.
