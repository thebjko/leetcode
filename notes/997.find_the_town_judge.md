# [997. Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-22)

The town judge trusts nobody. Everybody except the town judge trusts the town judge. There is exactly one person that satisfies these conditions, if exists.

## My Solution

I used nested loop.

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            cnt = 0
            for a, b in trust:
                if a == i:
                    break
                if i == b:
                    cnt += 1
            else:
                if cnt == n-1:
                    return i
        return -1

```

## Some Others

I've found some unusual solution:

```python
f = open("user.out",'w')
while True:
    try:
        n = int(input())
        trust = input()[2:-2].split('],[')
        trust_him = [1]*(n+1)
        he_trust = [1]*(n+1)
        for i in trust:
            if i == '':
                break
            i, j = map(int, i.split(','))
            trust_him[j] += 1
            he_trust[i] = 0
        ans = -1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if he_trust[i] and trust_him[i] == n:
                ans = i
        print(ans, file=f)
    except:
        f.close()
        exit(0)

```

For now I have no clue how on earth this works(the whole input and output). But for the logic, it seems that he uses dynamic programming. Then he iterates dp table to find out who is the town judge.

### [Inam_28_06](

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findJudge(self, n, trust):
        trusting = [0] * (n + 1)
        trusted = [0] * (n + 1)

        for t in trust:
            trusting[t[0]] += 1
            trusted[t[1]] += 1

        ans = -1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if trusting[i] == 0 and trusted[i] == n - 1:
                ans = i

        return ans

```

He simply indicates who is being trusted and who is trusting, then iterates through the table to figure out who the judge is.
