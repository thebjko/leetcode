# [2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-18)

This problem involves the efficient allocation of meeting rooms to a set of scheduled meetings, each defined by a start and end time. The goal is to determine the room number that hosts the maximum number of meetings. If multiple rooms hold the same maximum number of meetings, the solution should return the room with the lowest number. By addressing this problem, algorithms developed for this type of scheduling challenge can be adapted to improve efficiency in real-world scenarios where resource allocation and scheduling are essential components.

## Approach 1: Sorting and Counting

This approach uses nested loops. It basically iterates through rooms for every meeting schedule.

```python
class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        meetings.sort()
        room_availability_time = [0] * n
        meeting_count = [0] * n

        for s, e in meetings:
            min_time, min_index = float('inf'), -1
            for index, time in enumerate(room_availability_time):
                if time < min_time:
                    min_time, min_index = time, index
                if time <= s:
                    room_availability_time[index] = e
                    meeting_count[index] += 1
                    break
            else:
                room_availability_time[min_index] = e-s+min_time
                meeting_count[min_index] += 1
        
        return meeting_count.index(max(meeting_count))

```

## Approach 2: Sorting, Counting using Priority Queues

Instead of iterating through the entire list of rooms, this approach uses priority queue to get the earliest available room.

```python
class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        heapify(unused_rooms := [i for i in range(n)])
        used_rooms = []
        meeting_count = [0] * n

        for s, e in sorted(meetings):
            while used_rooms and used_rooms[0][0] <= s:
                _, room = heappop(used_rooms)
                heappush(unused_rooms, room)
            if unused_rooms:
                room = heappop(unused_rooms)
                heappush(used_rooms, (e, room))
            else:
                room_availability_time, room = heappop(used_rooms)
                heappush(
                    used_rooms,
                    (e-s+room_availability_time, room)
                )
            meeting_count[room] += 1
        return meeting_count.index(max(meeting_count))

```

Pushing used room indices into `unused_rooms` is particularly important for me, because I could not think of a way to deal with a case where the next start time is, for example, 17, and meetings which end at 12, 13 occupies room 2, 1. In this case the meeting should use room 1 instead of room 2 which becomes available sooner.
