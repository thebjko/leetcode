# [1609. Even Odd Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/even-odd-tree/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-29)

1. At even-indexed level, all nodes must be odd and in strictly increasing order.
2. At odd-indexed level, all nodes must be even and in strictly decreasing order.

## My solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isEvenOddTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def bfs(q, level):
            if not q:
                return True

            q2 = []
            prev = -1
            for index, node in enumerate(sorted(q, reverse=level&1, key=attrgetter('val'))):
                val = node.val
                if val != q[index].val or (not (level&1)^(val&1)) or val == prev:
                    return False
                prev = val
                for next_node in (node.left, node.right):
                    if next_node:
                        q2.append(next_node)

            return bfs(q2, level+1)
        q = [root]
        return bfs(q, 0)

```

It uses bfs. Very inefficient. I think the inefficiency is comming from sorting. Deleting `q` before going to the next recursion does not help much on memory.

### Approach 1: Depth-First Search

It uses recursive preorder traversal. A key point would be how to save previous node's value on the same level.

```python
class Solution:
    def isEvenOddTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        prev = []

        def dfs(current: TreeNode, level: int) -> bool:
            # Base case, an empty tree is Even-Odd
            if current is None:
                return True

            # Compare the parity of current and level
            if current.val % 2 == level % 2:
                return False

            # Add a new level to prev if we've reached a new level
            while(len(prev) <= level):
                prev.append(0)

            # If there are previous nodes on this level, check increasing/decreasing
            # If on an even level, check that current's value is greater than the previous on this level
            # If on an odd level, check that current's value is less than the previous on this level
            if prev[level] != 0 and \
                    ((level % 2 == 0 and current.val <= prev[level]) or \
                     (level % 2 == 1 and current.val >= prev[level])):
                return False

            # Add current value to prev at index level
            prev[level] = current.val

            # Recursively call DFS on the left and right children
            return dfs(current.left, level + 1) and dfs(current.right, level + 1)
        
        current = root
        return dfs(current, 0)

```

### Approach 2: Breath-First Search

```python
class Solution:
    def isEvenOddTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        # Create a queue for nodes that need to be visited and add the root
        queue = deque()
        current = root
        queue.append(current)

        # Keeps track of whether we are on an even level
        even = True

        # While there are more nodes in the queue
        # Determine the size of the level and handle the nodes
        while queue:
            size = len(queue)

            # Prev holds the value of the previous node in this level
            prev = maxsize
            if even:
                prev = -maxsize

            # While there are more nodes in this level
            # Remove a node, check whether it satisfies the conditions
            # Add its children to the queue
            while size > 0:
                current = queue.popleft()

                # If on an even level, check that the node's value is odd and greater than prev
                # If on an odd level, check that the node's value is even and less than prev
                if (even and (current.val % 2 == 0 or current.val <= prev)) or \
                        (not even and (current.val % 2 == 1 or current.val >= prev)):
                    return False

                prev = current.val
                if current.left:
                    queue.append(current.left)
                if current.right:
                    queue.append(current.right)
                # Decrement size, we have handled a node on this level
                size -= 1

            # Flip the value of even, the next level will be opposite
            even = not even

        # If every node meets the conditions, the tree is Even-Odd
        return True

```

This approach uses nested loop to separate each level. Other parts are similar to Approach 1.
