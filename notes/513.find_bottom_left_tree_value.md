# [513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-bottom-left-tree-value/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-28)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.

## My Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findBottomLeftValue(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        x = -1
        def bfs(q):
            nonlocal x
            if not q:
                return
            x = q[0].val
            q2 = deque()
            while q:
                node = q.popleft()
                for next_node in (node.left, node.right):
                    if next_node is None:
                        continue
                    q2.append(next_node)
            bfs(q2)
        bfs(deque([root]))
        return x

```

With recursive bfs, I could solve this easily. There were few other solutions.

### DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def findBottomLeftValue(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.maxDepth = -1
        self.bottomLeftValue = 0
        self.dfs(root, 0)
        return self.bottomLeftValue

    def dfs(self, current: TreeNode, depth: int):
        if not current:
            return
        
        if depth > self.maxDepth:  # If true, we discovered a new level
            self.maxDepth = depth
            self.bottomLeftValue = current.val

        self.dfs(current.left, depth + 1)
        self.dfs(current.right, depth + 1)
        return

```

This approach uses pre-order dfs recursively with tailing depth. As it traverses down the tree, it checks depth and if depth is greater than what has been recorded, it assign the current value to `self.bottomLeftValue`. The first one, which are left ones, will be recorded because it is pre-order.

### BFS Right to Left

```python
class Solution:
    def findBottomLeftValue(self, root):
        queue = deque()
        current = root
        queue.append(current)

        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()

            if current.right:
                queue.append(current.right)

            if current.left:
                queue.append(current.left)

        return current.val

```

A BFS solution with reversed traversal direction.
